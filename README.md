**NOTE**: This is a **sample** application to help you understand how Semantic Kernel and AI can work in Web Applications. This sample is **NOT FOR PRODUCTION** deployments.

# Chat Copilot Sample Application

This sample allows you to build your own integrated large language model (LLM) chat copilot. The sample is built on Microsoft [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) and has three components:

1. A frontend application [React web app](./webapp/)
2. A backend REST API [.NET web API service](./webapi/)
3. A [.NET worker service](./memorypipeline/) for processing semantic memory.

These quick-start instructions run the sample locally. They can also be found on the official Chat Copilot Microsoft Learn documentation page for [getting started](https://learn.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/chat-copilot/getting-started).

To deploy the sample to Azure, please view [Deploying Chat Copilot](./scripts/deploy/README.md) after meeting the [requirements](#requirements) described below.

> **IMPORTANT:** This sample is for educational purposes only and is not recommended for production deployments.

> **IMPORTANT:** Each chat interaction will call Azure OpenAI/OpenAI which will use tokens that you may be billed for.

# Instructions

## Windows

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.
   > NOTE: Ensure that you have [PowerShell Core 6+](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) installed. This is different from the default PowerShell installed on Windows.
1. Clone this repository
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/chat-copilot
   ```
1. Setup your environment.

   The following is a script to help you install the dependencies required. Feel free to install `dotnet`, `nodejs`, and `yarn` with your method of choice or use this script.

   ```powershell
   cd <path to chat-copilot>\scripts\
   .\Install.ps1
   ```

   > NOTE: This script will install `Chocolatey`, `dotnet-8.0-sdk`, `nodejs`, and `yarn`.

   > NOTE: If you receive an error that the script is not digitally signed or cannot execute on the system, you may need to [change the execution policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.3#change-the-execution-policy) (see list of [policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.3#powershell-execution-policies) and [scopes](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.3#execution-policy-scope)) or [unblock the script](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7.3#example-4-unblock-a-script-to-run-it-without-changing-the-execution-policy).

1. Configure Chat Copilot.

   ```powershell
   .\Configure.ps1 -AIService {AI_SERVICE} -APIKey {API_KEY} -Endpoint {AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT}
   ```

   - `AI_SERVICE`: `AzureOpenAI` or `OpenAI`.
   - `API_KEY`: The `API key` for Azure OpenAI or for OpenAI.
   - `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`: The Azure OpenAI resource `Endpoint` address. This is only required when using Azure OpenAI, omit `-Endpoint` if using OpenAI.

   - > **IMPORTANT:** For `AzureOpenAI`, if you deployed models `gpt-4o` and `text-embedding-ada-002` with custom names (instead of the default names), also use the parameters:

     ```powershell
     -CompletionModel {DEPLOYMENT_NAME} -EmbeddingModel {DEPLOYMENT_NAME}
     ```

     Open the `.\Configure.ps1` script to see all of the available parameters.

1. Run Chat Copilot locally. This step starts both the backend API and frontend application.

   ```powershell
   .\Start.ps1
   ```

   It may take a few minutes for Yarn packages to install on the first run.

   > NOTE: Confirm pop-ups are not blocked and you are logged in with the same account used to register the application.

   - (Optional) To start ONLY the backend:

     ```powershell
     .\Start-Backend.ps1
     ```

## Linux/macOS

1. Open Bash as an Administrator.
1. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/chat-copilot
   ```
1. Configure environment.

   The following is a script to help you install the dependencies required. Feel free to install `dotnet`, `nodejs`, and `yarn` with your method of choice or use this script.

   ```bash
   cd <path to chat-copilot>/scripts/
   ```

   **Ubuntu/Debian Linux**

   ```bash
   ./install-apt.sh
   ```

   > NOTE: This script uses `apt` to install `dotnet-sdk-8.0`, `nodejs`, and `yarn`.

   **macOS**

   ```bash
   ./install-brew.sh
   ```

   > NOTE: This script uses `homebrew` to install `dotnet-sdk`, `nodejs`, and `yarn`.

1. Configure Chat Copilot.

   1. For OpenAI

      ```bash
      ./configure.sh --aiservice OpenAI --apikey {API_KEY}
      ```

      - `API_KEY`: The `API key` for OpenAI.

   2. For Azure OpenAI

      ```bash
      ./configure.sh --aiservice AzureOpenAI \
                     --endpoint {AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT} \
                     --apikey   {API_KEY}
      ```

      - `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`: The Azure OpenAI resource `Endpoint` address.
      - `API_KEY`: The `API key` for Azure OpenAI.

      **IMPORTANT:** If you deployed models `gpt-4o` and `text-embedding-ada-002`
      with custom names (instead of the default names), you need to specify
      the deployment names with three additional parameters:

      ```bash
      ./configure.sh --aiservice AzureOpenAI \
                     --endpoint        {AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT} \
                     --apikey          {API_KEY} \
                     --completionmodel {DEPLOYMENT_NAME} \
                     --embeddingmodel  {DEPLOYMENT_NAME}
      ```

1. Run Chat Copilot locally. This step starts both the backend API and frontend application.

   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

   It may take a few minutes for Yarn packages to install on the first run.

   > NOTE: Confirm pop-ups are not blocked and you are logged in with the same account used to register the application.

   - (Optional) To start ONLY the backend:

     ```powershell
     ./start-backend.sh
     ```

## (Optional) Run the [memory pipeline](./memorypipeline/README.md)

By default, the webapi is configured to work without the memory pipeline for synchronous processing documents. To enable asynchronous document processing, you need to configure the webapi and the memory pipeline. Please refer to the [webapi README](./webapi/README.md) and the [memory pipeline README](./memorypipeline/README.md) for more information.

## (Optional) Enable backend authentication via Azure AD

By default, Chat Copilot runs locally without authentication, using a guest user profile. If you want to enable authentication with Azure Active Directory, follow the steps below.

### Requirements

- [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)
- [Azure AD Tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant)

### Instructions

1. Create an [application registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) for the frontend web app, using the values below

   - `Supported account types`: "_Accounts in this organizational directory only ({YOUR TENANT} only - Single tenant)_"
   - `Redirect URI (optional)`: _Single-page application (SPA)_ and use _http://localhost:3000_.

2. Create a second [application registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) for the backend web api, using the values below:
   - `Supported account types`: "_Accounts in this organizational directory only ({YOUR TENANT} only - Single tenant)_"
   - Do **not** configure a `Redirect URI (optional)`

> NOTE: Other account types can be used to allow multitenant and personal Microsoft accounts to use your application if you desire. Doing so may result in more users and therefore higher costs.

> Take note of the `Application (client) ID` for both app registrations as you will need them in future steps.

3. Expose an API within the second app registration

   1. Select _Expose an API_ from the menu

   2. Add an _Application ID URI_

      1. This will generate an `api://` URI

      2. Click _Save_ to store the generated URI

   3. Add a scope for `access_as_user`

      1. Click _Add scope_

      2. Set _Scope name_ to `access_as_user`

      3. Set _Who can consent_ to _Admins and users_

      4. Set _Admin consent display name_ and _User consent display name_ to `Access copilot chat as a user`

      5. Set _Admin consent description_ and _User consent description_ to `Allows the accesses to the Copilot chat web API as a user`

   4. Add the web app frontend as an authorized client application

      1. Click _Add a client application_

      2. For _Client ID_, enter the frontend's application (client) ID

      3. Check the checkbox under _Authorized scopes_

      4. Click _Add application_

4. Add permissions to web app frontend to access web api as user

   1. Open app registration for web app frontend

   2. Go to _API Permissions_

   3. Click _Add a permission_

   4. Select the tab _APIs my organization uses_

   5. Choose the app registration representing the web api backend

   6. Select permissions `access_as_user`

   7. Click _Add permissions_

5. Run the Configure script with additional parameters to set up authentication.

   **Powershell**

   ```powershell
   .\Configure.ps1 -AiService {AI_SERVICE} -APIKey {API_KEY} -Endpoint {AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT} -FrontendClientId {FRONTEND_APPLICATION_ID} -BackendClientId {BACKEND_APPLICATION_ID} -TenantId {TENANT_ID} -Instance {AZURE_AD_INSTANCE}
   ```

   **Bash**

   ```bash
   ./configure.sh --aiservice {AI_SERVICE} --apikey {API_KEY} --endpoint {AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT} --frontend-clientid {FRONTEND_APPLICATION_ID} --backend-clientid {BACKEND_APPLICATION_ID} --tenantid {TENANT_ID} --instance {AZURE_AD_INSTANCE}
   ```

   - `AI_SERVICE`: `AzureOpenAI` or `OpenAI`.
   - `API_KEY`: The `API key` for Azure OpenAI or for OpenAI.
   - `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`: The Azure OpenAI resource `Endpoint` address. This is only required when using Azure OpenAI, omit `-Endpoint` if using OpenAI.
   - `FRONTEND_APPLICATION_ID`: The `Application (client) ID` associated with the application registration for the frontend.
   - `BACKEND_APPLICATION_ID`: The `Application (client) ID` associated with the application registration for the backend.
   - `TENANT_ID` : Your Azure AD tenant ID
   - `AZURE_AD_INSTANCE` _(optional)_: The Azure AD cloud instance for the authenticating users. Defaults to `https://login.microsoftonline.com`.

6. Run Chat Copilot locally. This step starts both the backend API and frontend application.

   **Powershell**

   ```powershell
   .\Start.ps1
   ```

   **Bash**

   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

## Optional Configuration: [Ms Graph API Plugin with On-Behalf-Of Flow](./plugins/OBO/README.md)

This native plugin enables the execution of Microsoft Graph APIs using the On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow with delegated permissions.

The OBO flows is used to ensure that the backend APIs are consumed with the identity of the user, not the managed identity or service principal of the middle-tier application (in this case the WebApi).

Also, this ensures that consent is given, so that the client app (WebApp) can call the middle-tier app (WebApi), and the middle-tier app has permission to call the back-end resource (MSGraph).

This sample does not implement incremental consent in the UI so all the Graph scopes to be used need to have "Administrator Consent" given in the middle-tier app registration.

More information in the [OBO readme.md](./plugins/OBO/README.md).

### Requirements

Backend authentication via Azure AD must be enabled. Detailed instructions for enabling backend authentication are provided below.

### Limitations

- Currently, the plugin only supports GET operations. Future updates may add support for other types of operations.
- Graph queries that return large results, may reach the token limit for the AI model, producing an error.
- Incremental consent is not implemented in this sample.

# Troubleshooting

1. **_Issue:_** Unable to load chats.

   _Details_: interaction*in_progress: Interaction is currently in progress.*

   _Explanation_: The WebApp can display this error when the application is configured for a different AAD tenant from the browser, (e.g., personal/MSA account vs work/school account).

   _Solution_: Either use a private/incognito browser tab or clear your browser credentials/cookies. Confirm you are logged in with the same account used to register the application.

2. **_Issue:_**: Challenges using text completion models, such as `text-davinci-003`

   _Solution_: For OpenAI, see [model endpoint compatibility](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/model-endpoint-compatibility) for
   the complete list of current models supporting chat completions. For Azure OpenAI, see [model summary table and region availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#model-summary-table-and-region-availability).

3. **_Issue:_** Localhost SSL certificate errors / CORS errors

   ![Cert-Issue](https://github.com/microsoft/chat-copilot/assets/64985898/e9072af1-e43c-472d-bebc-d0082d0c9180)

   _Explanation_: Your browser may be blocking the frontend access to the backend while waiting for your permission to connect.

   _Solution_:

   1. Confirm the backend service is running. Open a web browser and navigate to `https://localhost:40443/healthz`
      - You should see a confirmation message: `Healthy`
      - If your browser asks you to acknowledge the risks of visiting an insecure website, you must acknowledge this before the frontend can connect to the backend server.
   2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` or refresh the page to use the Chat Copilot application.

4. **_Issue:_** Yarn is not working.

   _Explanation_: You may have the wrong Yarn version installed such as v2.x+.

   _Solution_: Use the classic version.

   ```bash
   npm install -g yarn
   yarn set version classic
   ```

5. **_Issue:_** Missing `/usr/share/dotnet/host/fxr` folder.

   _Details_: "A fatal error occurred. The folder [/usr/share/dotnet/host/fxr] does not exist" when running dotnet commands on Linux.

   _Explanation_: When .NET (Core) was first released for Linux, it was not yet available in the official Ubuntu repo. So instead, many of us added the Microsoft APT repo in order to install it. Now, the packages are part of the Ubuntu repo, and they are conflicting with the Microsoft packages. This error is a result of mixed packages. ([Source: StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73753672/a-fatal-error-occurred-the-folder-usr-share-dotnet-host-fxr-does-not-exist))

   _Solution_:

   ```bash
   # Remove all existing packages to get to a clean state:
   sudo apt remove --assume-yes dotnet*;
   sudo apt remove --assume-yes aspnetcore*;
   sudo apt remove --assume-yes netstandard*;

   # Set the Microsoft package provider priority
   echo -e "Package: *\nPin: origin \"packages.microsoft.com\"\nPin-Priority: 1001" | sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/99microsoft-dotnet.pref;

   # Update and install dotnet
   sudo apt update;
   sudo apt install --assume-yes dotnet-sdk-8.0;
   ```

# A note on branches

Every release is associated with a release branch. For instance, release [v0.9](https://github.com/microsoft/chat-copilot/releases/tag/v0.9) is on a branch called [0.9](https://github.com/microsoft/chat-copilot/tree/0.9).
Once a release is out, its branch will no longer be updated. The exception to this is the latest release branch, which will only receive bug fixes.
This is to provide some stability to those for whom breaking changes and being on the bleeding edge (with the bugs it can entail) is not a desirable option.
